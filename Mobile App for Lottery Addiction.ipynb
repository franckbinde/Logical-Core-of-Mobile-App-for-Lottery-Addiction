    "In the 6/49 lottery, six numbers are drawn from a set of 49 numbers that range from 1 to 49. A player wins the big prize if the six numbers on their tickets match all the six numbers drawn. If a player has a ticket with the numbers {13, 22, 24, 27, 42, 44}, he only wins the big prize if the numbers drawn are {13, 22, 24, 27, 42, 44}. If only one number differs, he doesn't win. For the first version of the app, we want players to be able to calculate the probability of winning the big prize with the various numbers they play on a single ticket (for each ticket a player chooses six numbers out of 49). So, we'll start by building a function that calculates the probability of winning the big prize for any given ticket.\n",
